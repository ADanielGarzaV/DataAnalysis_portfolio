🧠 Data Analytics Portfolio — Daniel Garza

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio, where I explore real-world datasets using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Flask.
Each project demonstrates a key step in the analytics workflow — from data cleaning and SQL exploration to dashboard design and full-stack data integration.

📊 Featured Projects
🛒 1. Fullstack E-Commerce Funnel Analysis (PostgreSQL + Flask + Power BI)
Files:
ecommerce_funnel_analysis.sql · View_to_Purchase_Funnel_Project.pdf · ecommerce-funnel-app/ (Fullstack folder)

Overview:
Built an end-to-end e-commerce funnel analysis and web dashboard combining PostgreSQL, Flask API, and a frontend visualization.
Analyzed over 1M user behavioral records to identify conversion rates and time-to-purchase patterns.

Highlights:
SQL funnel logic for view → cart → purchase with CTEs and aggregations
Flask REST API endpoints serving live JSON data (/api/funnel, /api/category, /api/brand)
Frontend visualization using Plotly.js
Power BI report for KPI and brand/category comparisons

Key Insight:
Smartphones led with a 7.7% conversion rate — Samsung outperformed Apple with a higher cart-to-purchase conversion despite lower average prices.
